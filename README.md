Inflation Forecasting in  Pakistan 


This project aims to forecast inflation using advanced statistical and machine learning models, focusing on Pakistan and comparing with USA data. The tasks are structured as follows:

 Task 01: Data Collection
Collected data for the dependent variable (Inflation) and five independent variables based on literature review. Data sources include World Development Indicators (WDI), International Financial Statistics (IFS), Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

 Task 02: Summary Statistics
Used R to compute and discuss summary statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Quartiles) for all variables included in the model.

 Task 03: Box and Whisker Plots
Constructed boxplots for all variables in one diagram using different colors. Identified and interpreted any outliers in the dataset.

 Task 04: Scatter Plot Matrix
Created a scatter plot matrix of all variables on one grid. Each part of the grid is interpreted to understand relationships between variables.

 Task 05: Model Implementation
For Pakistan, implemented and compared the following models:

ARIMA (for time series forecasting)

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

Elastic Net Regression
